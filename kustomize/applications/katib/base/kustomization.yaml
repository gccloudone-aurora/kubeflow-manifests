  # TODO:
  #   Apply Aurora’s updated AuthorizationPolicy for Katib.
  #   This replaces the upstream rule that only allows traffic from the
  #   Istio ingress gateway and instead permits calls originating from the
  #   kubeflow-service-account, which is the actual identity used for
  #   internal UI-to-UI mesh communication in secure Kubeflow deployments.
  #   Required for correct functionality under Istio AuthorizationPolicy
  #   enforcement and zero-trust mesh configurations.
